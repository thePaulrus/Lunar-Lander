# .obj Files

.obj files are an open format used for mesh data

It can generally be imported/exported by all 3d modeling software

The files only store basic geometry data, some programs export more data in a slightly modified format, but that extra data isn’t part of the “standard”, so may not always load correctly in other programs

#### Basic .obj File Format

```
# .obj of a uv-mapped triangle  
v -1 -1 0  
v 1 -1 0  
v 0 1 0  
vt 0 0  
vt 1 0  
vt 0.5 1  
vn 0 0 -1  
f 1/1/1 2/2/1 3/3/1
```

#### Vertex positions

Vertex positions always start with a single ‘v’  
```
v x y z w
```
The ‘w’ is optional and can be ignored for now

example: a sprite at z=0
```
v -1 -1 0  
v 1 -1 0  
v -1 1 0  
v 1 1 0
```

#### UV Coordinates

Texture coordinates start with ‘vt’  
```
vt u v w
```
The ‘w’ is optional and can be ignored for now

example: four texture coordinates for our box
```
vt 0 0  
vt 1 0  
vt 0 1  
vt 1 1
```

#### Vertex Normals

Vertex normals start with ‘vn’  
```
vn x y z
```
example: 2d box with one vertex normal pointing in negative z direction
```
vn 0 0 -1
```

#### Faces

Faces put all of this data together, they start with an ‘f’  
```
f v/vt/vn v/vt/vn v/vt/vn ...
```
The face will have 3 vertices as a minimum, but can have more

example: one quad for our face  
```
f 1/1/1 2/2/1 4/4/1 3/3/1
```

example: two triangles for our face  
```
f 1/1/1 2/2/1 3/3/1  
f 2/2/1 4/4/1 3/3/1
```

Not all .obj files will have uv coordinate and normals

Faces can be in any of the following formats
```
f v v v ...
f v/vt v/vt v/vt ...
f v//vn v//vn v//vn ...
f v/vt/vn v/vt/vn v/vt/vn ...
```

Face attributes will be indexed starting with 1

Faces are stored counter-clockwise

#### Other Details

There are other options that could be used within .obj files
- vertices can be separated into objects and groups
- object lines start with an ‘o’ followed by the name of the object
- group lines start with a ‘g’ followed by the name of the group
- the entire model or a single object/group could have a material file
- material lines start with ‘usemtl’ followed by a filename

All of these can be ignored, but you’ll be left with a single mesh that can only be drawn with a single material

# Parsing the File

Steps to load/parse a basic .obj file
- Load the entire file into a memory buffer
- Parse each line one by one
- For each line:
	- Check what type the line is ‘v’, ‘vt’, ‘vn’ or ‘f’
	- For ‘v’, ‘vt’ and ‘vn’, store the values in a vector for that type
	- For ‘f’ types:
		- Push 3 or more vertices of VertexFormat type into a vector
		- Each VertexFormat will copy values from the other 3 vectors
- Create a new Mesh using the vector of VertexFormat type
- We won't optimize the mesh, so the vertices array will contain a bunch of triangles
	- This makes indices useless, so you can either modify the mesh class to allow for meshes that don't use indices
	- Or, you can simply pass in a list of numbers from 0 -> verts.size(), which is functionally the same, but has some overhead cost that isn't a concern for now

```c++
	long length = 0;
	char* buffer = LoadCompleteFile( objfilename, &length );
	if( buffer == 0 || length == 0 )
	{
		delete[] buffer;
		return;
	}

	// Split the string at line endings
	char* next_token = 0;
	char* line = strtok_s( buffer, "\n", &next_token );

	// Keep looping as long as there are lines:
	while( line )
	{
		// Print out the line to see if it's working.
		OutputMessage( "%s\n", line );

		// TODO: Process the line.

		// Go to the next line
		line = strtok_s( 0, "\n", &next_token );
	}
```

# Breaking down a single line:

#### sscanf / sscanf_s

C++ has a function that can read a formatted string called sscanf
It works with the same string format used for printf
Follow this link for more info: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/sscanf/
Visual studio has marked sscanf as unsafe and provides an alternative sscanf_s
sscanf is considered unsafe because it has no safety mechanism and might write past the end of the buffer provided (aka a Buffer overrun)

#### sscanf example from cplusplus.com (reformatted)

```c++
#include <stdio.h>

void main()
{
    char* sentence = "Rudolph is 12 years old";
    char str[20];
    int i;

    sscanf( sentence, "%s %*s %d", str, &i );
    printf( "%s: %d\n", str, i );
}

Output:
Rudolph: 12
```

#### sscanf_s example from cplusplus.com (reformatted)

```c++
#include <stdio.h>

void main()
{
    char* sentence = "Rudolph is 12 years old";
    char str[20];
    int i;

    sscanf_s( sentence, "%s %*s %d", str, 20, &i );
    printf( "%s -> %d\n", str, i );
}

Output:
Rudolph -> 12
```

#### Simpler working examples (I hope)

```c++
char* sentence = "1"
int value;
sscanf_s( sentence, "%d", &value );
```

```c++
char* sentence = "-1.05"
float value;
sscanf_s( sentence, "%f", &value );
```

```c++
char* sentence = "ready 123"
int value;
sscanf_s( sentence, "ready %d", &value );
sscanf_s( sentence, "%*s %d", &value );
```

```c++
char* sentence = "1/2/3      4/5"
int v[5];
sscanf_s( sentence, "%d/%d/%d %d/%d", &v[0], &v[1], &v[2], &v[3], &v[4] );
```

#### More sscanf_s examples

```c++
    char* sentence = "Rudolph is 12 years old";
    char str[20];
    int i;

    sscanf_s( sentence, "%s %*s %d", str, 20, &i ); // Fills both, returns 2
    sscanf_s( sentence, "%s is %d", str, 20, &i );  // Fills both, returns 2

    sscanf_s( sentence, "%*s %*s %d", &i );         // Fills i, returns 1
    sscanf_s( sentence, "Rudolph is %d", &i );      // Fills i, returns 1

    sscanf_s( sentence, "%s was %d", str, 20, &i ); // Fills str, returns 1
    sscanf_s( sentence, "George is %d", &i );       // returns 0
    sscanf_s( sentence, "George is %d", str );      // mismatch, assert
```

#### Comparing C strings

```c++
	char* line = "test sentence";
	char* line2 = "test sentence";
	
	if( line == line2  ) // Don't match
	
	if( strcmp( line, line2  ) == 0 ) // Match
	
	for( int i=0; i<strlen( line ); i++ ) // Manual string compare
	{
		if( line[i] != line2[i] )
		return false;
		return true;
	}
```

#### Comparing a single character

```c++
	char* line = "v";
	
	if( line == "v" ) // Compare one char* to another
	// This is comparing the addresses to the 2 string
	// Which will not be equal.
	
	if( line[0] == 'v' ) // compare the first character
```
